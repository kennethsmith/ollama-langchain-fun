Harris in many ways is picking up where Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign left off in a pitch for normalcy and decency, but with a polish that gives Democrats fresh loads of optimism. Where Trump advisers saw opportunities to drag down Harris by tying her to all of Biden\u2019s record, the candidate only intermittently kept up the strategy. Instead, Trump kept his focus on his own political record, aiming largely for the audience that takes their cues from right-wing sources and shares his belief that he should still be in the White House."

Consider factors such as their command of the issues, their ability to articulate their positions clearly and concisely, and their demeanor and communication style.\n\nUltimately, the outcome of a political debate is a matter of interpretation and personal opinion, and it is up to each individual to evaluate the candidates based on their own values, beliefs, and priorities."
